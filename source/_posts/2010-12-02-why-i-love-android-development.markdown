Android development strikes a sweet spot for me, as a developer seeking to be a contributing member in the software community.

I have taken a few shots at web development and it just doesn’t feel right. While it is such a visual and rewarding experience. I just can’t shake the feeling of it being the most phenomenal kludge.

It is easy to distribute and consume in an almost completely platform independent environment. I love being able to send a someone a link and say, “Hey, check this out!” and have them be greeted by a slick web app.

But despite all of this it still feels wrong.

Android offers you a much more consistent development platform while simultaneously keeping  much of the ease of distribution alive.

I like how Android development feels like a merger between web accessibility and desktop consistency.

I do realize that Android has its own host of complexities such as the numerous possible devices, API versions, and the challenges of the application lifecycle.

It won’t say that it is perfect, but I am comfortable saying that it feels very right.
