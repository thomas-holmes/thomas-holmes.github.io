The other week I came across a neat programming challenge called The RPS(Rock Paper Scissors) Programming Competition. The goal is to write a Python program that plays RPS against other programs. Each match is a best of 1,000.

This challenge caught my interest with its unique combination of ease and depth. While my best submission has dropped to a roughly 60% win rate there are some truely clever programs submitted. I am certain I can improve greatly and develop a submission over the coming weeks that is able to achieve a 70% win rate.

I would encourage anyone who enjoys programming or problem solving to give it a go.
