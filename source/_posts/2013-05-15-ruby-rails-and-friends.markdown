For the last 6 months I’ve been slowly teaching myself Ruby on Rails. It’s been a lot of fun and I’ve loved most every minute of it. My last run at web development was several years ago before technologies like Heroku were common. I spent some time trying to learn Django but did not find the ecosystem quite as mature as I would have liked. I found myself stuck playing sysadmin on a webserver, which is a role I am neither interested in or great at. So I hung up web development, experimented with mobile went back to desktop application development.

Four years later, enter Ruby on Rails. I’m having a blast. The tools are great. The community is wonderful. And after spending every day for two years with my nose buried in Visual Studio I am thrilled to be back to vim. It is _bliss_.

I’m active on GitHub and attend several regular meetings and extra events with the Ruby community. I’ve made tons of new friends and enjoying all of it. I’ve hardly played a video game in months and I can hardly believe it. I’ve got motivation to work a full day and then another three or four every night. It’s all fun.

If you feel like you’re missing something in your life as a developer try to find a local group. It has made all of the difference.
